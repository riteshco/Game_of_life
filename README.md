# Game of Life - Pygame Implementation

This is a Pygame-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The game features both a classic and a colored version, along with interactive controls and a pixel-art-styled menu system.

## Features

### Core Features:
- **Classic Game of Life**: Implements Conway's rules with a standard grid and simple visualization.
- **Colored Mode**: A more visually appealing version of the game where different cell states are represented in colors.
- **Randomized Grid Generation**: Users can randomize the initial grid with a configurable probability.
- **User Interaction**: Place and remove cells dynamically with mouse clicks.
- **Generations Counter**: Displays the current generation count.
- **Pixelated UI Elements**: Styled buttons and menu elements to give a unique retro feel.

### Controls
- **Q**: Toggle play/pause.
- **F**: Toggle generation count display.
- **T**: Randomize grid based on the set probability.
- **B**: Return to the main menu.
- **R**: Reset the grid.
- **Left Mouse Click**: Place a cell.
- **Right Mouse Click**: Remove a cell.
- **+/- Buttons** (in the control menu): Adjust cell size.
- **+/- Buttons** (in the control menu): Adjust randomization chance.

## Installation & Running the Game
### Requirements:
Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.

```sh
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Game
```sh
python main.py
```

## Future Enhancements
- **More Customization Options**: Allow users to change grid size dynamically.
- **Save/Load Patterns**: Implement a way to store and retrieve game states.
- **AI-based Pattern Recognition**: Recognize common patterns dynamically and display insights.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Introduce competitive or cooperative game modes.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the UI with animations and smoother transitions.
